The amount and variety of data that is available is growing rapidly and at a quicker pace. There is a wider range of data available in many formats, including audio, video, computer logs, purchase transactions, sensors and social networking sites. This has created big data, which are large, often unstructured data sets that are available, potentially in real time.

In our team we want to understand the impact it may have on the statistical processes and outputs within the Office. This project aims to investigate the advantages and challenges of using big data, and to develop a longer term strategy for using big data in official statistics.

All of our work fully complies with legal requirements and our obligations under the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/osr/code-of-practice/). Part of the research within the project considers the ethical issues associated with using these types of data sources within official statistics.
